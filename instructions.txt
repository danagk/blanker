This application takes in an input text file (file MUST end in .txt) and inputs blanks
in place of words in randomly-generated places. The resulting file is outputted as
"blanked-[original file name]" and saved to the working directory. 

The user can then choose to fill in the blanks interactively. If desired, the program will
print the words from the blanked file to the console until it encounters a blank, at which point
the output pauses and the user must type their guess for what word was originally in place of
the blank. Only one try will be given, and the correct answer will not be revealed.

After the user has worked through the entire file, they can see how words they got correct and
view their errors, if desired.

Some tips:

* Blanks are sized relative to the words they replace.
* Guesses are case- and punctuation-insenstive.
* This program works best when the text file has lines of 5-15 words. It performs poorly
   if the text file has a few, very long lines, or many, very short lines.
