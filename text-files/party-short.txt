I hopped off the plane at L.A.X.
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in the cab
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
